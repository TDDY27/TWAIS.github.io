    "description": "I am a junior in Computer Science and Information Engineering at National Taiwan University. At the NTU AI Safety Lab, my research focuses on two areas: (1) mechanistic interpretability, where I develop sparse autoencoder–based reward models to fine-tune LLMs for multi-preference alignment (e.g., balancing helpfulness and harmlessness), and (2) machine unlearning via adversarial perturbation methods, including work on CLIP model tuning. I joined the lab through the NTU AI Safety reading group, drawn by my interest in mechanistic interpretability and sparse autoencoder research.\n\nExpected graduation date: 2027",
