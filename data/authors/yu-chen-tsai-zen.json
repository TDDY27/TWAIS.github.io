    "description": "NTU Math Undergraduate, working in NTU HCI Lab. I've been actively contributing to this group for the past year, participating in lively discussions and public events. I also served as a workshop facilitator at the 2025 Taiwan AI Safety Summer Workshop, where I presided over peer-to-peer discussions on alignment and safety. What got me into AI safety: a desire to understand the meaning and beauty of intelligence and thought, and the belief that aligning artificial general intelligence may illuminate a deeper understanding of humans. I share research takeaways to spark awareness within my Threads community.\n\nExpected graduation date: July 31, 2026 (Expected to pursue a direct PhD at NTU.)",
