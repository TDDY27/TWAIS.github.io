description: "PhD student @ Penn Criminology"
summary: "Vic was a member of the NTU AI Safety Reading Group from 2023 to 2024. His broad research includes on digital transformation in government settings, particularly in policing and public safety. His studies utilize social network analysis and machine-learning-infused causal inference techniques to model the complex social dynamics and impacts of police technology innovations.
Given the increasing demand for AI applications in everyday policing and the broader criminal justice system, he believes it is essential for public safety and criminal justice scholars to have a stronger understanding of AI safety. This knowledge is crucial to prevent new technologies from exacerbating existing biases and to maintain a balance between digital surveillance and privacy."
